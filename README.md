# Steve

Steve is a C++ program that composes music and generates MIDI files from scratch.

## Assumptions
- Harmony is defined such as, at any given time (at a beat granularity), the set of all tones played fits inside a chord
- Melody is defined by a scale (kept throughout an entire music and common to all instruments), all tones must be fit in the scale
- Rhythm is defined by the fact that notes can only have a power of two duration, and a note can only be placed on a position dividable by its duration
